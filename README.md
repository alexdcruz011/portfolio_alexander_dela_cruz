# portfolio_alexander_dela_cruz
Greetings! This is my portfolio that houses my data pipeline projects. This is a work in progress. Thank you very much


1. CSV to Google Cloud Storage project - alexdcruz011/first_etl_project

    - This project aims to simulate a pipeline that Extracts data through API. I chose to use Mockaroo's service to obtain random data and then perform Data Manipulation on it to match the desired template/format required. Then once transformed will be uploaded to a Data Lake such as Google Cloud Storage in this case.
