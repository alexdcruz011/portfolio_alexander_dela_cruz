Greetings! This is my portfolio that houses my data pipeline projects. This is a work in progress. Thank you very much


1. CSV to Google Cloud Storage project - alexdcruz011/first_etl_project

https://github.com/alexdcruz011/first_etl_project

    - This project aims to simulate a pipeline that Extracts data through API. I chose to use Mockaroo's service to obtain random data and then perform Data Manipulation on it to match the desired template/format required. Then once transformed will be uploaded to a Data Lake such as Google Cloud Storage in this case.

2. Employee Data Generator - alexdcruz011/employee_data_generator

https://github.com/alexdcruz011/employee_data_generator

    - This project creates a QTWidget that generates Employee data by receiving an number input in a text box to indicate how many records to create, selecting a folder to upload data via a button, button to generate the data, and finally a button to Export data in xlsx format to selected folder.
